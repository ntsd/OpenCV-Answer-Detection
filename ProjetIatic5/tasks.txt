The tasks in order of preference:
0) move to 4 boxes per question
1) check if 2 or 3 or 4 boxes are checked or if none.
2) rotation works well
3) processing "n" pages per student: if you have two pages or more: for example:
                   First page: question1: score 10
                   First page: question2: score 20
                   First page: question3: score 40
                   First page: question4: score 30
                   First page: question5: score 10
                   Second page: question6 (5 + 1): score 10
                   Second page: question7 (5 + 2): score 20
                   Second page: question8 (5 + 3): score 10
                   Second page: question9 (5 + 4): score 30
                   Etc ......
Algorithm of 3): we find the student number "21202864 for example" just in the first page, and if we find pages where there is not a student number, we will consider that they belong to "21202864" .
